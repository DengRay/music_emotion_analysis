# music_emotion_analysis

we create a CNN model to calculate the VALENCE-AROUSAL of the music with the dataset DEAM

you can download the DEAM dataset from the official website , and test our model in detail

we find that cnn model is easy over-fitted,so we recommend you use the rnn model and take the time sequences into account.

The project is embedded in an open source music text matching platformï¼šhttps://github.com/murchinroom
